The Mautic Community are a worldwide distributed team of volunteers who are passionate about Mautic, Marketing Automation, and Open Source technologies.

The community comes together to build, improve, and share Mautic, united by the belief in empowering organizations with the tools they need to deliver world-class automation and personalized experiences to their customers.

The Mautic project primarily organizes around the following channels: 

- :xref:`Mautic Community Forums`
- :xref:`Mautic Community Slack`


How to try Mautic?
******************

Mautic is available to download for free, just head over to the website where you can :xref:`Download Mautic`, allowing you to explore its full capabilities without restrictions when you host it yourself. You can also start a :xref:`Mautic Trials` for 14 days to take Mautic for a spin in a hosted environment, and if you choose to continue with a paid plan, 40% of the revenue comes directly back to the Mautic project.

For optimal performance, it's recommended to host Mautic on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) rather than shared hosting, particularly if you intend to use it in a production setting on lower end hosting which often have limited resources, which may impact Mautic's efficiency and performance.
