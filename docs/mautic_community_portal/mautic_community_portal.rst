The heart of the Mautic Community is the :xref:`Community Portal`.

It's the central place where everything relating to the community happens. Everything from proposing and organizing meetup groups, teams, and working groups to voting on the next members of the Mautic Council happens on the portal.

It's integrated with a single sign-on service, so you can use the same username and password as you use on the Forums.

Members of Mautic enjoy extra privileges, such as proposing candidates in elections and voting. To gain membership, use the :xref:`membership-option` available in the community portal. The system then syncs your email, and you can claim membership through your user profile.

This section offers various tutorials and video resources to help users navigate the community portal. If something seems unclear or a resource appears missing, use :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel on Slack to ask for support.
