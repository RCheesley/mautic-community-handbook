In this article, learn how to sign in and set up your user profile.

.. tip::

   You can watch the short tutorial :xref:`Mautic Community Portal - Sign in and user profile` on YouTube, if you prefer a video format.

Logging in
**********

The first thing to mention is that with the new Mautic Community Portal, you can use your existing forum username and password. So if you click this button, it opens up the dialog to allow you to log in with your Mautic Community Forum login.

If you don't yet have a login, it allows you to create one, and you can then use those credentials on the forum as well.

If you can't remember your password, you can use the option to send a password reset request. If you have problems creating an account, make sure you are using a unique username, name, and email. If you still get stuck, please ask in :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel on Slack.

Accept the terms and conditions
*******************************

The first time you log in - and any time thereafter when there have been substantial changes to the terms and conditions - you must accept them before you proceed. To do this, review the terms and conditions and, at the bottom of the page, click 'I agree with these terms'. You can't continue using the platform if you refuse the terms, and a popup gives you the option to delete your account if you wish.

Certain cookies permit features on the portal which you can choose to accept or reject on the cookie popup. It's important to understand that certain features, such as embedded note taking, won't work if you don't accept the relevant cookies. If you come across resources like this, a prompt notifies you to review and update your settings to use that feature if your current setting restricts it.

Setting language preferences
============================

At the top of the page, you'll notice that there are different languages available if you prefer. Select the language you wish to use and the interface changes into that language. It's worth noting that some aspects of the website may not be fully translated because they're community created, and as a result may only be available in the language they were originally created in. If you would like to help with translating more of the content, please post in the ``#translations`` channel on :xref:`slack`.

Claiming membership
*******************

Once logged in, you have the option to claim a Mautic membership.

There is a :xref:`membership-option` as a way to support the Mautic community while also being able to join in with governance processes like voting. You can become an individual member for $100 a year or a pro rated amount based on where you pay taxes, and you can become a corporate member. Read more about the :xref:`membership-option` and explore the perks of corporate membership in this :xref:`corporate-membership`.

If you are already a member of Mautic, you can select this option to match up your membership with your account on the community portal. This allows you to participate in votes, engage in the General Assembly, create proposals, and so forth.

.. tip::

   In this short video, :xref:`Mautic Community Portal - Memberships` on YouTube, you can watch more about claiming your membership status.

Mautic maintains a list of who is actually an active member at this point in time, synchronized on a weekly basis.

Unable to claim membership
==========================

If you're a member and you're not able to claim your membership as you would expect, please drop a message on :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel on Slack, because it might be that the email address you used when you paid on Open Collective doesn't actually match the email address that you use on the community portal.

Some manual tweaks can fix this quickly. So drop a message in the channel and the team can take a look.

Managing your account
**********************

Check the dropdown menu item underneath your name. This allows you to customize your account, your public profile, your timezone, and also see notifications and direct messages. 

My Account
==========

This is where you can configure your avatar that others see in the portal whenever you engage here. You can configure your email address and all of your details and which locale you prefer to browse the website using.

Notifications
=============

The notification settings is important. This allows you to actually control what you get notified about within the community and how frequently.

.. image:: images/notifications.png

  :alt: VSCode screenshot showing how to change branches

You can select or deselect the things that you would like to receive notifications about. You can choose if you get a daily summary email, a weekly summary email, real time or no updates by email. Daily or weekly would be a good option.

Updates
========

Updates is a bit like a newsletter feature. The community may send an update every now and then by email. If you want to receive those, then you can select that here.

Direct messages
===============

Do you want to allow anyone to send you a direct message? This allows anyone to send you a direct message on this platform, even if you don't follow them.

Deselect the option if you only want people that you follow to send you a direct message.

My Interests
============

This allows you to decide what topics you'd like to see in your timeline. It's recommended to leave them all selected and if it becomes too noisy you can turn them off in the future.

My Data
=======

The 'My Data' section allows you to download all the information held on you in this system, and to delete your account.

My Public Profile
=================

Under 'My Public Profile' in the top user menu, this is what your profile looks like to the public.

Timeline
========

This shows all of the ways in which you have engaged across the portal by time, with a dropdown filter that allows you to only show certain types of activity. This section **isn't** visible to any other user than the logged in user themselves, because it can also contain items that should be visible only to that participant.

Activity
========

.. image:: images/activity.png
  :width: 800px
  :alt: VSCode screenshot showing how to change branches

Activity is showing the activity that you're involved in. This might include endorsing/supporting proposals, commenting on/creating resources, and so forth. Again, it's filterable by type, but this shows on your public profile and other people can see it.

Badges
======

For those of you who like gamification, there are lots of badges available. Each badge explains how you can earn the badge, and there's different levels as well. Som have fun engaging in the platform and earning those levels.

Follows and followers
=====================

The follows tab shows the resources and individuals that you follow. Following a participant or a group means that you receive notifications about the activity done by those participants or groups on the platform. Depending on settings you may also need to follow someone to direct message them.

The followers tab shows a list of participants and groups which follow your user account.

Groups
======

The group section contains all the groups that you belong to. For more information on groups, refer to the :doc:`/mautic_community_portal/groups` section.

Understanding the fields on the user profile
********************************************

When viewing a profile in the front end, there are some fields on the left hand side underneath the avatar. Here's what they mean.
