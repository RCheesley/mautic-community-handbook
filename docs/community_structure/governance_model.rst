Governance model
################

Following the :xref:`acquia-acquisition` which included all resources relating to the Mautic Community, Acquia and the community developed a governance model. The community accepted and adopted the proposal following a period of community consultation.

Read more in the :xref:`governance-proposal` and the :xref:`governance_followup` which addressed questions raised by the community. The Community Council made subsequent adaptations during the Community Summit in November 2019 to arrive at the model outlined below.

The Community Council made further updates in May 2020 with the change in project leadership and introduction of the Founder position.

The aim of the governance model is to enable and empower volunteers. The Mautic Community want to encourage people to take up responsibilities and have a say in the direction of the Mautic Open Source project, while working collaboratively with Acquia.

Community structure
*******************

The structure of the community includes five teams, each led by a Team Leader and Assistant Team Leader, with working groups under them.

:doc:`Community Team`
:doc:`Education Team`
:doc:`Legal & Finance Team`
:doc:`Marketing Team`
:doc:`Product Team`

Each of these teams are responsible for establishing and overseeing working groups within the team.

The Mautic community governance model
*************************************

Initially the team leadership positions are self-elected from within the team. See :doc:`Leadership Team` for the current post holders.

Going forward the Project Lead selects the Team Leader and Assistant Team Leader positions from the community-elected Working Group Leaders and Assistant Working Group Leaders.

Delegation of resources
=======================

Acquia delegates stewardship of resources to the relevant Team Leader, who is responsible for managing them on a day-to-day basis and ensuring appropriate, responsible use of the resources.

.. note::
    As an example, the Marketing Team Lead is responsible for owning the content shared on community social media accounts and in the community newsletter, in line with guidance from Acquia and using their PACSI matrix - see below - to determine who needs to inform or consult throughout the process.

Term durations and elections
============================

Team Leader, Assistant Team Leader, Working Group Leader and Assistant Working Group Leader positions have a specified initial term - dependent on the team - with a review at the half way point.

Terms are where possible timed to avoid elections for multiple leadership positions happening at the same time.

Steering groups
===============

Team Leaders and Assistant Team Leaders create the relevant Steering Group assigned to their teams.

The steering groups are an opportunity for the Team Leaders of related areas in the community to work together on larger projects such as an overall communications strategy, product roadmap/strategy and budget preparation, escalating up to the Community Council and receiving feedback from the Council as appropriate.

The Mautic community council
============================

The Community Council consists of 4 Acquians and 4 Mauticians to discuss issues which impact the Open Source project as a whole.

The four Acquians currently are the Mautic Project Lead, Project Sponsor, Technical Community Lead and Community Specialist. Acquia appoints these positions, the Project Sponsor and may vary over time subject to the needs of the Council.

Annual elections decide the positions of Community Representatives - recruited from the Team Leads and Assistant Team Leads who choose to stand for nomination. The Project Lead will retain a casting vote.

The Community Council operates more on consensus than on votes, seeking agreement from the people who have to do the work.

The role of Project Lead has the ability, with regard to Acquia employees, to ask people to work on specific projects, specific feature goals and specific bugs. They also have a casting vote on the Product Steering Group and the Community Council, should it come to a vote. This capacity isn't used lightly.

The Mautic Community believes that the community functions best when it can reach broad consensus about a way forward. However, it's not uncommon in the Open Source world for there to be multiple good arguments, no clear consensus, and for open questions to divide communities rather than enrich them. The debate absorbs the energy that might otherwise have gone towards the creation of a solution.

In many cases, there is no one 'right' answer, and what's needed is a decision more than a debate. The Project Lead acts to provide clear leadership on difficult issues, and set the pace for the project.

Some examples of how this casting vote might come into effect could include:

-  Decisions without a consensus - any time there is an equal split on a decision, the Project Lead may use their casting vote to decide the vote
-  Technical decisions - for example frameworks to adopt or key strategic objectives - where there is no clear consensus from the community, or the suggestions provided could be detrimental to the long term vision for the project, the Project Lead can determine the path to take
-  Feature prioritisation - if a particular feature needs prioritizing, the Project Lead can instruct Acquia employees to work on developing that feature

Finance and budget
==================

Mautic now uses the :xref:`opencollective` to manage its finances.

Each year, Team Leads make a budget request for the coming year. The Community Council reviews all requests in December, with a budget adopted by the council in the December Community Council meeting.

Transactions on the Open Collective are open and visible to all.

About Mautic's Core team
========================

.. vale on

Development is open and available to any member of the Mautic community.

All fixes and improvements happen through pull requests to the code.

This code is open source and publicly available. The Release Leader reviews pull requests and code submissions, deciding with the core team what's merged.

The following voting process decides situations when a decision isn't clearly evident.

Who are the Mautic core maintainers and what do they do?
========================================================

The Mautic Core team - who are part of the Product Team - consists of 5 groups. Each team member can belong to only one group at a time. Any privilege listed for a particular group is also available to all higher priority groups. The Mautic Core groups, in descending order of priority are as follows:

.. vale off 

The Project Lead
----------------

.. vale on

The Project Lead elects members into any other group, oversees project vision and direction, and makes decisions on proposed changes. The Project Lead listens to the counsel of trusted advisors and individuals
respected for their contributions to Mautic. Acquia appoints the Project Lead.

Read about the full responsibilities and expectations of the Project Lead in the :doc:`Project Lead Definition`.

.. vale off

The Technical Community Lead
----------------------------

.. vale on

The Technical Community Lead supports the technical growth and development of the Mautic project and community. This role is pivotal in empowering other developers in the Mautic Community, and setting up the
foundations for them to become active contributors.

They're the face of the developer community, and a central point of call for any technical issues.

The Technical Community Lead also has primary responsibility for supporting in-person sprints, releases, and being a bridge between the community and Acquia from the technical perspective.

Read more about the full responsibilities and expectations of the Technical Community Lead in the :doc:`Technical Community Lead Description`.

The Project Founder
-------------------

.. vale on

The Mautic Project Founder is DB Hurley. He remains an ambassador for the Mautic project. The Mautic Community can ask the Founder to speak and represent the project at events. There are no responsibilities or expectations in the governance model specific to the Project Founder. They don't have any voting rights, or any involvement in the governance model.

Core Team
---------

Release Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

The release leader is responsible for a particular major version release and implementing the project's vision as it relates to a release. This role may be a Mautician or an Acquian. The Project Lead appoints the Release Leader.

.. vale off

Core Committers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

The core committers are a small team that review proposed changes and have commit access to the core repository. The Project Lead selects core committers based on their previous experience and project involvement.

.. vale off

Tiger Team Leaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

The Tiger Team leaders are individuals who have a level of responsibility over a particular area of the project (for example a particular Mautic feature or bundle). The Project Lead appoints Tiger Team leaders. Core contributors who have made substantial contributions may apply for Tiger Team Leader status by writing to the Project Lead.

.. vale off

Core Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

Core Contributors are those individuals who assist in other areas of the project including patch contributions, documentation, translations and other key services for the Mautic core. Contributions are peer-reviewed and decided upon by the Core Committers, Release Leader, or Project Lead. Anyone can submit code contributions.

Voting policy
-------------

All members of the Core Team cast votes. A member may change their vote at any time during the discussion. Positive votes require no explanation. A member must justify a negative vote by technical or objective logic. A Core Team member can't vote on any code they submit.

Merging policy
--------------

The voting process on any particular pull request must allow for enough time for review by the community and the Core Team. This involves a minimum of 2 days for minor modifications and a minimum of 5 days for significant code changes. Minor changes involve typographical errors, documentation, code standards, minor CSS, JavaScript, and HTML modifications. Minor modifications don't require a voting process. All other submissions require a vote after the minimum code review period and one or more core members must approve them - with no core members voting against.

.. vale off

Applying to join the Core Team
------------------------------

.. vale on

In the Mautic Community, membership of the Core Team members operates on meritocracy. The Mautic Community actively seeks to empower active community members and  to provide those demonstrating increased involvement everything needed for their continued success.

.. vale off

Core Membership revocation
--------------------------

.. vale on

Revoking of a Mautic Core membership may occur for any of the following reasons:

-  Refusal to follow the rules and policies listed herein
-  Lack of activity for the previous 6 months
-  Willful negligence or intent to harm the Mautic project
-  Upon decision of the project leader

Revoked members may re-apply for core membership following at 12 month period.

Assigning responsibility
------------------------

The following Responsibility Assignment Matrix illustrates how the Product Team might make decisions in different scenarios which may arise in the community.

While the most common format for such matrices is RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), the Mautic Community decided to adopt a variation used by the Drupal community called PACSI (Perform, Accountable, Control, Suggest, Informed) which more closely matches the community's collaborative nature.

Key
~~~

Perform (P)
^^^^^^^^^^^

The role/s that carry out the activity.

Placed in the column of the role/s that predominantly drive those changes, but this doesn't preclude other roles from also carrying out work.

Accountable (A)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The role/s ultimately accountable for the correct and thorough completion of the task, and often the ones who delegate the work to the performer (P).

Control (C)
^^^^^^^^^^^

The role/s that review the result of the activity - other than the Accountable, A. They have a right of veto and their advice is binding.

Suggest (S)
^^^^^^^^^^^

The role/s consulted for advice based on their expertise. They provide non-binding advice.

These are role/s whose input via two-way communication is actively sought, though this doesn't preclude others from making suggestions.

Informed (I)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The role/s to inform of the result of the activity.

Examples of PACSI matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that if a change includes multiple rows in this table, this suggests involvement of multiple roles.

Below is an example of a potential matrix for the Product Team: example Product Team PACSI

-  The Project Lead may proactively make or override these decisions if they deem it necessary.

Each team would develop its own PACSI relating to their own area of stewardship, created in collaboration with Acquia via the Community Manager and Product Lead.

As an example (provided to illustrate how this might work, rather than using factually correct responsibilities), the Marketing team might develop the matrix below with examples of tasks that arise within their team, and clarity around who is responsible for making decisions, taking actions, etc.

Teams develop and review these as the team grows and responsibilities change.

And the Legal team's might look like this:
