It’s to be inclusive and add value to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. This commitment extends to fostering a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

This code of conduct outlines expectations for all community participants, whether in-person or online, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all Mautic activities, including but not limited to:

Mautic encourages all participants in online activities to help create safe and positive experiences for everyone, everywhere.

Open source & culture citizenship
*********************************

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source and culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between the actions and their effects on the community.

.. vale off

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

.. vale on

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure the community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

Welcoming to all
****************

.. vale off

This community is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of experience level, job role, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, national origin, citizenship and immigration status, neurodiversity, mental health, or socio-economic status.

Expected behavior
*****************

The community expects all members to engage in the following behaviors:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Guide conversations toward issue resolution.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Alert Mautic team members if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Unacceptable behavior
*********************

The community doesn't tolerate the following harassing behaviors:

.. vale off

- **Violence and Threats of Violence** aren't acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”) online.
- **Public or private harassment** is never acceptable in any form.
- **Personal Attacks** Conflicts inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It's not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas isn't acceptable. It's important to speak directly when disagreements arise or improvements are needed, but discussions must remain respectful, professional, and focused on the issue at hand.
- **Derogatory Language** Hurtful or harmful language is never acceptable in any context related to: background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, personal appearance, body size, native language, age, ability, neurodiversity, mental health, race and/or ethnicity, national origin, citizenship and immigration status, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location.
- **Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact** Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact isn't acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent isn't acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.
- **Disruptive Behavior** Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, isn't tolerated. This includes spamming community discussions with the solicitation of unwanted products or services.
- **Influencing Disruptive Behavior** Influencing or leading such activities is treated the same way as the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.
- **Corporate Promotions** Sharing of demo/trial/landing page links and other corporate promotions are never permitted unless explicitly requested by a community member. The only exceptions are that the moderated Commercial forum category may be used to promote opportunities which may be relevant for members of the community (for example job opportunities, freelance gigs) and Mautic Community Partners may promote their products and services on their partners page.
- **Scraping contacts** by name or any other personally identifiable information for unsolicited communication is never acceptable in any form.
